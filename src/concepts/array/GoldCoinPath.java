    /*
     * Given a 2d matrix containing gold coins on each node. A thief is standing on position (0,0) of the grid. He/She can only move in rightward or downward direction and will collect all the coins
     * present on the node. Find the number of paths through which a thief can collect maximum no. of coins in a given 2d array.
     * 
     * P.S : You just need to print number of path and not the path which the person followed.
     * 
     * Example : 
     * 1 0 1 
     * 2 0 2 
     * 0 0 3
     * 
     * Answer : 1
     * 
     * Explanation : Only 1 path is present which will give answer as 8 Path : 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2 -> 3
     * 
     * 1 2 1 2 
     * 0 0 1 0 
     * 4 0 1 2 
     * 1 1 1 1
     * 
     * Answer : 4
     * 
     * Explanation : 4 paths are present which will give answer as 8 Path 
     * : 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 
     * : 1 -> 0 -> 4 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 
     * : 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 2 -> 1 
     * : 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
     * 
     * Expected Complexity : O(n^2)
